# Scenario
# Using one of the comparison operators in Python, write a simple program that takes the parameter n as input,
#  which is an integer, and prints False if n is less than 100, and True if n is greater than or equal to 100.

n = int(input("Enter an integer value for n: "))
if (n >= 100):
    print (True)
elif (n <= 100):
    print (False)
